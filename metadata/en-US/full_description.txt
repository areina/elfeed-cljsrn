Read your feed entries from the device and have them synchronized with your
Emacs. The app connects remotely to Elfeed web API and it gets the feeds content
through it.

This app requires that you have elfeed running in your computer and elfeed api
accessible remotely. Check the project page for more info: http://github.com/areina/elfeed-cljsrn


The app is open source and the source code is available in the project page.
